    <h2>Orders</h2>
    <p>Orders can be placed through our website basket, WhatsApp, or email. All orders are subject to availability and will be confirmed by us before printing begins. We aim to respond to all orders within 24 hours.</p>

    <h2>Pricing &amp; Payment</h2>
    <p>All prices shown on the site are in GBP (&pound;). We accept cash and card payment on collection. Payment is taken before or on collection, whichever works best for you. Prices may change without notice, but confirmed orders will be honoured at the agreed price.</p>

    <h2>Collection</h2>
    <p>All orders are currently collection only, based in Edinburgh. We'll arrange a convenient time and location once your order is ready. We'll let you know an estimated completion time when we confirm your order.</p>

    <h2>Custom Prints</h2>
    <p>Custom print requests can be submitted via our custom print form. We'll review your idea and get back to you with feasibility, pricing, and a time estimate. Custom prints are priced on a case-by-case basis depending on size, complexity, and material. We reserve the right to decline requests we're unable to fulfil.</p>

    <h2>Colours</h2>
    <p>Products can be printed in any of our available filament colours. Colours shown on the website are approximate — actual shades may vary slightly due to printing conditions and screen differences. If a specific colour is out of stock, we'll let you know and offer alternatives.</p>

    <h2>Returns &amp; Refunds</h2>
    <p>Because all items are 3D-printed to order, we don't offer returns or refunds unless an item arrives faulty or significantly different from what was agreed. If there's a problem with your order, please get in touch within 7 days of collection and we'll do our best to sort it out.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about these terms, you can reach us via <a href="https://wa.me/message/LOBEWRYKAT5UI1" target="_blank">WhatsApp</a> or email at <a href="mailto:christo3dprints@gmail.com">christo3dprints@gmail.com</a>.</p>
